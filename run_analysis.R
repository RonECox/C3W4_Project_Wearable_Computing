# You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
# 
# 1 (Done) - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2 (Done) - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
#     measurement. 
# 3 (Done) - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4 (Done) - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
# 5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
#     with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
